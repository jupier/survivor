# Cursor AI Rules for Survivor Game

## Version Management

When making significant changes or pushing code:

- **Always bump the version** in `package.json` before committing changes
- Use semantic versioning:
  - **Patch** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
  - **Minor** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): New features, non-breaking changes
  - **Major** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes, major refactoring
- The version is automatically synced to `src/version.ts` via vite plugin
- Version is displayed in the game UI (bottom right corner)

## Automatic Version Bumping

The project has a pre-push git hook that automatically bumps the patch version when pushing. However, you should still manually bump versions for:

- Significant feature additions (use minor bump)
- Breaking changes (use major bump)
- When explicitly requested by the user

## Code Organization

- All game code is organized by feature in `src/game/`:
  - `core/` - Core game logic
  - `enemies/` - Enemy management
  - `player/` - Player logic
  - `menu/` - Menu systems
  - `weapons/` - Weapon systems
  - `pickups/` - Pickup items
  - `ui/` - UI components
  - `translation/` - Translation system
  - `assets/` - Asset loading
  - `sound/` - Sound management

## Best Practices

- Keep imports organized by feature
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing code patterns
- Update translations when adding new UI text
- Test changes before committing
